//~ * Map * ~

//TODO Together: Let's see a common approach we might have done in the past: our goal is to increase each element of an array by 1 [element + 1], then get an array back with those values

var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

var numbersAddOne = [];

for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i += 1) {
    numbersAddOne.push(numbers[i] + 1);
}
// console.log(numbersAddOne); // [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]

//TODO Together: Now, let's achieve the same result with the first part of our lesson: the MAP method~

let numbersAddOneMap = numbers.map(function(number){
    return number + 1;
})

console.log(numbersAddOneMap);

//As you can see, .map() accepts a callback function - that callback function is applied to each element in the collection. What about a dive into a deeper, more complicated collection?

const favoriteRestaurants = [
    {
        name: "India Palace",
        address: "8474 Fredericksburg Rd, San Antonio, TX 78229",
        phone: "(210) 692-5262",
        restaurantFeatures: ["buffet", "party room", "to-go"]
    },
    {
        name: "Taqueria Jalisco",
        address: "7094 Bandera Rd, San Antonio, TX 78238",
        phone: "(210) 543-9400" ,
        restaurantFeatures: ["to-go", "breakfast"]
    },
    {
        name: "Sukhothai Thai Restaurant Express",
        address: "7664 Tezel Rd Suite 105, San Antonio, TX 78250",
        phone: "(210) 314-1106",
        restaurantFeatures: ["to-go", "limited seating"]
    }
]


//TODO Together: Let's get all these restaurant names out of this array of objects with .map()!

let restaurantNames = favoriteRestaurants.map(function(restaurant){

    // return restaurant.name.split("").reverse().join("").toLowerCase(); //having fun with .map + method chain()

    return restaurant.name + ", phone: " + restaurant.phone; //Accessing two properties and combining in a new way
})

console.log(restaurantNames);

//TODO: Create your own array of (up to 3 and at least 2) restaurant objects building off of the basic list you created during the MapBox exercise (or build one anew!) ~5 mins

//TODO: Now, having created a personal array of restaurant objects for yourself, use .map() to get your favorite restaurant's names out of that collection, into another array, and out into the console! ~5 mins

//~ * Filter * ~

//TODO Together: Once again, let's take a look at the old way we might approach an issue: getting only one type of values out of an array (for example: even numbers only from an array of nums!)

// var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

// var evens = [];

// for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i += 1) {
//     if (numbers[i] % 2 === 0) {
//         evens.push(numbers[i]);
//     }
// }
// console.log(evens); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]


//TODO Together: Now, let's refactor the above using the ES6 .filter() method with the same goal: even numbers only!

let evens = numbers.filter(function(number){
    return number % 2 === 0;
})

console.log("es6 version of evens:");
console.log(evens);


//TODO Together: Using my favoriteRestaurants list, let's filter out all of the non-buffet restaurants

let hasBuffet = favoriteRestaurants.filter(function(restaurant){
    return restaurant.restaurantFeatures.includes("buffet");
})

console.log(hasBuffet);

//TODO: Each one of your restaurant arrays is unique, but, in that array, identify something to filter by - it could be as simple as "well, let me filter out all of the restaurants with names shorter than 8 characters" or get as complicated as you'd like!
// TODO: Once you've figured our what you want to filter, go ahead and write the necessary code to achieve what you wanted - remember to practice with .filter() and our ES6 verbiage!

//~ * Reduce * ~

//Reduce is an interesting animal in and of itself: it's a way to reduce a collection down to, typically, a single value of some kind:

//TODO Together: Let's sum up some numbers with the .reduce() method and a number array!

// let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

//in the past: we would have built out a loop, probably used a var of sum, and had a look inside of the loop of sum += numbers[i], spit out sum with the sum of our numbers

//In ES6 with .reduce(). .reduce() has a couple of components to it: .reduce(callbackFunction, initialValue)



//TODO Together: Let's take a step a bit deeper with .reduce() - .reduce()'s output can take many forms and shapes. For example, let's say we wanted to have a little Javascript that would count the length of the strings in an array and return that info back to us in an object. For example: ["Codeup", "San", Antonio", "Dallas", "Quasar", Cohort", "ES6"] would get us: Object { Codeup: 6, San: 3, Antonio: 7, Dallas: 6, Quasar: 6, Cohort: 6, ES6: 3 }

let stringArr = ["Codeup", "San", "Antonio", "Dallas", "Quasar", "Cohort", "ES6"];


//TODO: Let's make a new array of objects to use - make an array of objects [{},{},{}] consisting of a number of family members as objects with their name and ages as properties. Use .reduce() to sum up the age of those family members and see what it is! e.g. [{name: "Thurston Howell III", age: 50}, {name: "William Dean Howells", age: 83}] would be 133 by adding those two age properties together (50 + 83).
